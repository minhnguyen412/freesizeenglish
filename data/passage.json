Overall, a much larger percentage of Canadians and Americans had access to the Internet in comparison with Mexicans, and Canada experienced the fastest growth in Internet usage.",
            "In 1999, the proportion of people using the Internet in the USA was about 20%. The figures for Canada and Mexico were lower, at about 10% and 5% respectively. In 2005, Internet usage in both the USA and Canada rose to around 70% of the population, while the figure for Mexico reached just over 25%.",
            "By 2009, the percentage of Internet users was highest in Canada. Almost 100% of Canadians used the Internet, compared to about 80% of Americans and only 40% of Mexicans.",

            "There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people's lives, especially in the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on computers to research for information and to produce a perfect paper for school purposes. Others have decided to leave the original way of learning to get knowledge through online schools. These changes in the learning process have brought a special concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom.",
            "Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been helping some students to progress in their studies quicker than when compared with an original classroom. For example, in the same classroon, students have different intellectual capacities, thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies because of other's incapacity of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from teachers.",
            "However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the importance of studying in group and resprect other students, which helps them to improve their social skills.",
            "Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some student's deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students can have a bigger chance not to fail in a subject.",
            "In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will continue to be in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and its consequences."

            "Before the first decades of this century, it was a cultural imperative, almost universal, for adult children to become independent from their parents as quickly as possible.",
            "In fact, those who did not manage to do that were constantly criticized and/or caricatured."

            "As 1,200 children await results to see if they’ve been exposed to infectious diseases, a horror no parent should ever face, and the accused has yet to enter a plea or go through the court process, media commentary has begun to focus on how this case might have implications more broadly for male childcare workers.",
            "Early childhood education is a heavily female-dominated field and some past inquiries into child sexual abuse by male educators have suggested that, in efforts to avoid appearing discriminatory, male workers may be subject to less scrutiny.",
            "This dynamic is compounded by efforts for gender balance in childcare, particularly for the perceived benefits of male role models.",
            "Ironically, this fear of seeming biased can create the very conditions that offenders exploit – grooming colleagues, parents and children to commit abuse while hidden in plain sight."
