            "There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people's lives, especially in the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on computers to research for information and to produce a perfect paper for school purposes. Others have decided to leave the original way of learning to get knowledge through online schools. These changes in the learning process have brought a special concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom.",
            "Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been helping some students to progress in their studies quicker than when compared with an original classroom. For example, in the same classroon, students have different intellectual capacities, thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies because of other's incapacity of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from teachers.",
            "However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the importance of studying in group and resprect other students, which helps them to improve their social skills.",
            "Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some student's deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students can have a bigger chance not to fail in a subject.",
            "In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will continue to be in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and its consequences."

            "People born in 1990 are more than twice as likely to develop colon cancer, and more than four times as likely to develop cancer of the rectum than those born in 1950.",
            "They identified global increases in colorectal cancers. A study of 20 European countries showed that between 2004 and 2016, colorectal cancers had increased by almost 8% for those aged 20–29, almost 5% for people aged 30–39, and by 1.6% in the 40–49 age band.",
            "Even more shocking are figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wonder database in the U.S., which identified a 333% increase in the incidence of colorectal cancers among 15-19 year olds and a 185% increase among people aged between 20 and 24.",
            "Despite these apparently huge percentage increases, the authors emphasize that the absolute numbers of cancer diagnoses are still very much lower in those under 50 than in older people.",
            "However, the researchers on this study highlight the need for targeted awareness and interventions, particularly among younger age groups."
